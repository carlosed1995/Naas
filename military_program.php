		<p>The Bell 212 with the registration AN-121 and serial number 35058 was selected to be the first aircraft to go through the SLEP process, first undergoing detailed Phase A and B inspections using BHT-212-MM specifications. The inspections required the removal — and, as necessary, replacement — of all components including flight controls, fuel cells, instruments, avionics, and wiring. The entire drive system was overhauled, including the main rotor hub, rotor mast, swashplate, both tail rotor gear boxes, main transmission, and oil cooler assembly. Both main and tail rotor blades were inspected, repaired, and resurfaced. The landing gear was installed new. Re-Wire was done system and The Pratt & Whitney PT6T-3B Turbo Twin Pac engines were inspected and run in a test cell for functional checks.</p>
		<p>At the same time, the historical records of the aircraft were reviewed for discrepancies on parts life limits. The airframe was also "militarized," in your design and finish paint exterior. Covers were fabricated for the nose where electronic equipment had been located. Structural repairs were made throughout the airframe to extend its life,   IAW BHT-SRM and doors and windows was replaced. The airframe interior and all compartments were cleaned, inspected and repaired, then painted a gloss white for ease of inspection and cleaning. To increase performance in hot-and-high conditions, the aircraft was equipped with a BLR Fast Fin and tailboom dual strakes.
